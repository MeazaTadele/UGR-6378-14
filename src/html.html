            <h3><q>

            </q></h3>

            <br>

            <p> In a world where passion and dedication pave the path to success, I, Meaza Tadele, am a software student at Addis Ababa University, driven by my unwavering love for the field.

            <br>

            <p>Here are some key aspects of my journey:</p>
